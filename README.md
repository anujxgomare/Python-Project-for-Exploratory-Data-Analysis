In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis using Python to uncover insights from the Data set. The goal was to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. I utilized libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Key steps included:

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarized key metrics to understand data distributions.
Visualization: Created various plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to visualize trends and correlations.
Insights: Identified significant patterns that could inform further analysis or decision-making.
This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided a solid foundation for future projects in data science.
